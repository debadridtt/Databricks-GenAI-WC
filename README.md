This app is built to for the following functionalities:

- Chat with our GenAI agent to understand demographics, top locations around the city, Y-o-Y growth of real-estate prices, further development prospects, etc.
- Finally use the chatbot messages to shortlist locations, requirements, budget, amenities for properties, etc.
- Dashbaord visualizes information related to different properties across Mumbai, India
- Feed information gathered from Chatbot to Smart Broker GenAI to get recommendations of ideal properties for investment or for staying

The main motive of the app is to solve the below problems:

- Eliminate properties which are irrelevant. Property exploration is highly time consuming and energy consuming, even after so many resources available, the best options are not easily visible
- Recommended properties will have higher chances of getting converted into purchase, as we are using all information from the user to fulfill their needs
- Return on investment in the property is guaranteed as the GenAI and the dashboard helps the user with all questions that he/she might have
- With this app, whether someone plans to buy a property as investment or for staying, both purposes will be served as we tend to return most accurate list of properties available for the user
